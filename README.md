# Far-AwAY
 Game Overview:
Far Away is a web app game set in a dystopian future where humanity has been forced to evacuate Earth. The game follows the story of one of the last remaining humans, who is determined to send a message to the outer colony.

Story:
In this apocalyptic world, most of the population has left Earth to escape its unsafe environment. One of the few humans who stayed behind needs to send a casual message to the outer colony  (the message would be chosen by the players themselves). You would play as a fox, tasked with delivering this message, traveling through dangerous environments in space.

Gameplay:
Navigate through a series of levels aboard a rocket, facing hazardous dangers along the way.
As you progress, the threats become more intense, and you’ll encounter mysterious signals that suggest something isn’t quite right with the colony.
